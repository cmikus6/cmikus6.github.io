        <br>

        <p>My name is Chris and I am an aspiring data analyst.  I graduated from UVA with a degree in chemical engineering and a minor in materials science.  After graduating, I started working as a safety engineer and risk manager for the US Navy.</p>
        <p>In my free time, I like to stay active.  I ran a marathon in late October - something that you would have needed to be there to witness because it will never happen again. I also love playing volleyball, swimming, playing anything Zelda-related, and teaching myself Disney songs on the keyboard.</p>
